#Container classes
A container class is  a class designed ot hold an organize multiple instances of another type (either another class, or a fundamental type).
####Types of containers
- Value containers are compositions that store copies of the objects that they are holding (and thus are reponsible for creating and destroying those copies).
- Reference containers are aggregations that store pointers or references to other objects (and thus are not responsible for creation or destruction of those objects).
