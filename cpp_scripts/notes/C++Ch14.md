#Chapter 14: Namespaces

The notion of a namespace is provided to directly represent the notion of a set of facilities that
directly belong together.
The members of a namespace are in the same scope and can refer to each other without special notation, 
whereas access from outside the namespace requires explicit notation.
A namespace hsould express some logical structure: provide facilities that unite them in the eyes of their users.
The local lookup is not affected by the global same name.
