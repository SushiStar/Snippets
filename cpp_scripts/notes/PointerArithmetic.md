#Pointer arithmetic and array indexing
###Pointer arithmetic
When calculating the result of a pointer arithmetic expression, the compiler always multiplies the integer operand by the size of the object being pointed to. This is called **scaling**.
###Arrays are laid out sequentially in memory
By using the address-of operator (&), we can determine that arrays are laid out sequentially in memory.
