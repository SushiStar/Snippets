A vritual function makes its class a polymorphic base class. Derived classes can override virtual functions.
Virtual functions through base class pointers/references will be resolved at runtime. That is, a dynamic type
of the object is used instead of its static type.

A pure virtual function is a function whose declaration ends in =0;
A pure virtual function implicitly makes the class it is defined for abstract.
Abstract classes cannot be instantiated. Derived classes need to override/implement all inherited all pure virtual functions.
If they do not, they too will become abstract.
