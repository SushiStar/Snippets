A non-constructor function that is declared with a constexpr specifier is a constexpr function.
A constexpr function is a function that can be invoked within a constant expression.
A constexpr function must satisfy the following conditions:

It is not virtual.
Its return type is a literal type.
When initializing the return value, each constructor call and implicit conversion is valid in a constant expression.
Its function body is =delete or =default, otherwise its function body must contain only the following statements:
    null statements;
    static_assert declarations;
    typedef declarations that do not define classes or enumerations;
    using directives;
    using declarations;
    one return statement;

the function with contexpr specifier is implicitly inline;
