## Monotonic Stack / Queue

### Monotone stack
**Monotonic Stack contains the elements which are either increasing only or decreasing only.**

Monotonic stacks has the following properties:
* Meet the elements from the top of the stack to the bottom of the stack has strict monotonicity.
* Meet the last-in-first-out feature of the stack the sooner the element that is near the bottom of the stack.

Because the monotonic stack can only operate on top of the stack, it is generally used only where there is a limit on one side of the array

### Montone queue
A monotone queue is a data structure in which an element within a queue has strict monotonicity, which is divided into monotone increment queue and monotonically descending queue.

Monotone queue satisfies two properties:
* The monotonic queue must meet the strict monotonicity from the head to the end of the team.
* In front of the queue than the queue in order to the advanced team.
