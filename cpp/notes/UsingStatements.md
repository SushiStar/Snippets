#Using statements
***using declarations*** statement.
***using directive*** statement.
If a `using declaration` or `using directive` is used within a block, the `using statement` applies only within that block (it follows normal block scoping rules).

###Cancelling or replacing a using statement
Once a `using statement` has been declared, there's no way to cancel or replace it with a different `using statement` within the scope in which it was declared.
