Default arguments are different from constant arguments as constant arguments can't be changed whereas default arguments
can be overwritten if required.
Default arguments are overwritten if calling function provides value for them.
During calling of function, arguments from calling function to called function are copied from left to right.
Once default value is used for argument in function definition, all sbusequent arguments to it must have default value. It
can also be stated as default arguments are assigned from right to left.
