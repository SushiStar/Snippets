Most naming collisions occur in two cases:
1) Two (or more) definitions for a function (or global variable) are introduced into separate files that are compiled into the same program. This will result in a linker error, as shown above.
2) Two (or more) definitions for a function (or global variable) are introduced into the same file (often via an #include). This will result in a compiler error.
