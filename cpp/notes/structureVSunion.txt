A structure is a user defined data type available in C that allows to combining data items of different kinds. 
Structures are used to represent record. To define a structure you must you a the struct statement.

A union is a special data type available in C that allows storing different data types in the same memory location.
You can define an union with many data members, but only one member can contain a value at any given time. Unions
provide an efficient way of using the same memory location for multiple purposes.
To define a union, you must use the union statement in the same way as you did while defining a structure.
