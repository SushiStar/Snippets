By convention, global variables are declared at the top of a file, below the includes, but above any code.

Consider using a "g" or "g_" prefix for global variables to help differentiate them from local variables.

Global variables have file scope and static duration
Global variables have file scope (also informally called global scope or global namespace scope), which means
they are visible from the point of declaration until the end of the file in which they are declared. Once
declared, a global variable can be used anywhere in the file from that point onward.

Global variables are created when the program starts, and destroyed when it ends. This is called static duration.
Variables with static duration are sometimes called static variables.
Unlike local variables, which are uninitialized by default, static variables are zero-initialized by default.
